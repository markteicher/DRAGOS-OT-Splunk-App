OT Cybersecurity Glossary

## Air Gap: 
An age-old term used
to describe the disconnection
of a device or system from a
network or the internet at large.
Air gaps were once the primary
means of industrial cybersecurity
protection. Today they’re not only
ineffective and outdated, but they
also rarely exist with the rise
of IT/OT integration and digital
transformation.


## Common Industrial Protocol
(CIP): An industrial protocol
for industrial automation
applications that is supported
by the Open DeviceNet Vendors
Association (ODVA). CIP is
often at the nexus between OT
and IT networks. It is used in
industrial settings to integrate
applications that govern control,
safety, synchronization, motion,
configuration and information
in industrial equipment with
enterprise-level IT networks
and the internet. EtherNet/
IP, DeviceNet, CompoNet, and
ControlNet protocols all fall under
the CIP protocol umbrella.


## CRASHOVERRIDE: 
The first-ever
malware framework designed and
deployed to attack energy assets
in Ukraine in December 2016.
Critical Infrastructure: Assets,
machinery, systems and
networks that provide functions
that are necessary to maintain
our modern way of life, including
those that provide power, water,
telecommunications and
manufactured goods to society at
large.

## Crown Jewel Analysis: 
A process
of mapping an OT environment
and identifying the most valuable
assets—including facilities,
networks and systems crucial to
business missions or under high
safety thresholds—that would be
the first place to start in bolstering
OT cybersecurity monitoring
and controls and appropriately
managing OT cyber risk.

## Cybersecurity Management
System (CSMS): 
A methodical
approach to developing an
ICS cybersecurity program as
recommended by the IEC 62443
set of cybersecurity standards.
Data Logger: A software database
that collects and stores data
generated by ICS assets. They’re
typically high-performance
databases capable of processing
and storing high volumes of realtime data. Also referred to as data
historians or process historians.
Data Historian: A software
database that collects and
stores data generated by ICS
assets. They’re typically high performance databases capable
of processing and storing high
volumes of real-time data. Also
referred to as process historians
or data loggers.

##Distributed Control Systems
(DCS): 
A process control system
that connects autonomous
controllers, sensors and actuators
in a distributed system with no
centralized operator supervisory
control. DCS control loops are
designed for reliability and unlike
SCADA, DCS is typically controlled
and managed on premises rather
than remotely.
Embedded Device: A small
computer system-usually
comprised of hardware and
software—designed to carry out
a very specific function within
a larger computer system or
device. ICS systems are usually
comprised of a tapestry of
embedded devices.
Field Device: Industrial
equipment that controls actions or
measurement. Field devices can
include sensors, actuators, and
valves.
Fieldbus I/O Modules: An
interface module between a
central processor and industrial
machinery. They allow field input
devices like sensors and switches
to communicate with field output
devices like valves, drives and
indication lights.
5 Critical Controls: SANS Institute
identified five critical controls
for organizations to align ICS/
OT cybersecurity with their IT
cybersecurity readiness. These
five controls are: 1. ICS incident
response plan, 2. A defensible
architecture, 3. OT-specific
visibility and monitoring, 4.
Secure remote access, 5. Riskbased vulnerability management.
Human Machine Interface (HMI):
A hardware or software interface
in which an operator can interact
with an industrial controller.
HMIs can include everything
from physical control panels to
software-based dashboards.
Industrial Automation and
Control System (IACS): A
synonymous term for an
industrial control system (ICS)
used by the ISA/IEC 62443 series
of standards.
Industrial Control System (ICS):
A generalized term that refers to
the broad class of systems used
to control and monitor industrial
machinery and processes. ICS
typically includes both hardware
and software components that
can perform a range of tasks that
include carrying out programmable
actions on physical processes,
remote diagnostics, maintenance
actions and human interface.
Some common components
or subtypes of ICS include DCS,
SCADA, PLC and HMI systems.
